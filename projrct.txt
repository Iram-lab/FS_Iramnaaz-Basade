                                                                             Student Commute Optimizer (Full Stack)
                                                                        ______________________________________________


i] The overall flow of project:
_________________________________________


1)Student opens app → signs up or logs in with unique username.

2)Enters home and destination addresses.

3)Frontend sends route info (coordinates) to backend via REST.

4)Backend saves route and queries database to find overlapping routes using PostGIS spatial queries.

5)Backend returns a list of matched users (anonymous usernames with route overlap metadata).

6)Frontend displays matched users as icons on map.

7)Student clicks icon → opens chat window → WebSocket connection established.

8)Messages sent bi-directionally via WebSocket.

9)Students coordinate ride.

10)User can update route → backend recalculates matches dynamically.

ii] Technological Approach:
___________________________________

1. User Interface & Frontend

---Using React Native for cross-platform mobile app development.
Why? One codebase for iOS and Android reduces development and maintenance cost.
React Native integrates well with mapping libraries (Google Maps, Mapbox).

---Map integration via free or affordable APIs like OpenStreetMap or Mapbox (free tier).
Why? Google Maps has costs based on usage; Mapbox or OSM provide generous free tiers, lowering costs.
Minimal UI with simple input forms (home, destination) + map view + chat window.



2. Backend Architecture

---Using Spring Boot for backend REST APIs and WebSocket support.
Why? Robust, scalable, widely supported, and allows multi-threaded handling of requests efficiently.
Can be hosted on cost-effective cloud services (AWS EC2 t3.small, Google Cloud f1-micro, or Heroku free tier).
Implement REST APIs for route submission and fetching matched routes.
Use WebSocket for real-time chat.

3. Database

---Use PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for spatial queries.
Why? Open-source, powerful geospatial query support.
Cost-effective compared to proprietary GIS systems.
Use indexing on route geometries to speed up spatial queries and reduce computation time and cloud resources usage.

4. Route Matching Logic

Preprocess routes as polylines, and store as geography type in PostGIS.
Run spatial queries to find routes within a threshold distance (e.g., 200m).
Use ST_DWithin for fast proximity checks.
Filter matches based on overlap length or shared travel direction.
Perform matching only when routes are submitted or updated (event-driven) instead of continuous polling.
Reduces compute cost drastically.

5. User Privacy & Anonymity

Unique username enforcement at registration.
Simple username availability check, no PII collected.
Chat handled through anonymous usernames only, no personal data exchanged.

6. Hosting & Infrastructure

Host backend and database on cloud providers with free or low-cost tiers (e.g., AWS Free Tier, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean).
Use containerization (Docker) for easy deployment and scalability.
Implement caching (Redis or in-memory) to reduce DB load for frequent queries.

7. Optimization & Cost Saving Measures

Batch process matching during low-traffic periods or use event triggers.
Cache frequently requested matches on backend or CDN.
Compress and limit chat message size to minimize bandwidth.
Limit number of stored past routes/messages to reduce storage costs.

8. Real-time Communication

Use WebSocket for efficient, persistent connections instead of polling.
Implement simple pub/sub messaging channels on backend for scalability.

iii] Core Pseudo Code:
_________________________



a) Backend: Route Matching Algorithm (Spring Boot + PostGIS)
________________________________________________________________
// Assume Route is stored as a LINESTRING in PostGIS

public List<UserRoute> findMatches(LineString newRoute, UUID currentUserId) {
    // SQL Query (PostGIS): Find routes overlapping with newRoute within a threshold distance
    String sql = "SELECT user_id, route " +
                 "FROM user_routes " +
                 "WHERE user_id != :currentUserId " + 
                 "AND ST_DWithin(route::geography, :newRoute::geography, :distanceThreshold)";

    // Execute query with newRoute geometry and currentUserId to exclude self
    List<UserRoute> matchedRoutes = jdbcTemplate.query(sql, Map.of(
        "newRoute", newRoute.toText(),          // WKT format
        "currentUserId", currentUserId,
        "distanceThreshold", 200                // meters threshold for route proximity
    ), userRouteRowMapper);

    // Further filter by overlapping route length or other heuristics if needed

    return matchedRoutes;
}




b) Backend: Unique Username Registration
_______________________________________________
public boolean isUsernameAvailable(String username) {
    String sql = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE username = :username";
    int count = jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(sql, Map.of("username", username), Integer.class);
    return count == 0;
}

public User registerUser(String username) throws UsernameTakenException {
    if (!isUsernameAvailable(username)) {
        throw new UsernameTakenException();
    }
    // Insert user record with anonymous profile
    String sql = "INSERT INTO users (username) VALUES (:username)";
    jdbcTemplate.update(sql, Map.of("username", username));
    return getUserByUsername(username);
}




c) Frontend: Sending Route Data & Displaying Matches (React Native)
__________________________________________________________________________
async function submitRoute(homeLocation, destination) {
  // Call backend API with route info
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/routes', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      home: homeLocation,          // { latitude, longitude }
      destination: destination     // { latitude, longitude }
    }),
  });
  const matches = await response.json();

  // Display matches as anonymous icons on map
  setMatchedUsers(matches);
}

function onMatchIconClick(user) {
  // Open WebSocket chat window with selected user
  openChatWithUser(user.username);
}




d) Frontend: WebSocket Chat Connection (React Native)
_________________________________________________________
function openChatWithUser(username) {
  const ws = new WebSocket(`wss://api.example.com/chat?user=${username}`);

  ws.onopen = () => {
    console.log('WebSocket connected');
  };

  ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    // Append message to chat window
    displayIncomingMessage(event.data);
  };

  function sendMessage(message) {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({ message }));
  }
}
